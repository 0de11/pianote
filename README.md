This is a simple Godot game to increase piano key knowledge. Starts with two notes (C, D) and increases piano keys available as you gain in levels.

In the executable directory there are two installs:

- pianote.apk is an installer for Android. Touch-screen capabilities for pressing the keys.

- pianote.exe is an installer for Windows. Has the ability to register MIDI input from a real keyboard or electric piano! Also has touch-screen capabilities.
